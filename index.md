There's what looks like a better markdown explanation [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

This is just some text with nothing special.

```
Hello. This part has three backticks surrounding it.
```

# Heading size 1
## 2
### 3
#### 4
##### 5
###### 6

This is some more non special text.

- This line has a hyphen before it.
- As does this one.
